## Let's try these alternate methods for booting the board

### Factory boot

### Custom kernel and rootfs on second part of eMMC

### Loading kernel image, dtb file, initrd.img via TFTP from Host PC

### Custom kernel and rootfs on second part of SD card.

This is most convenient for frequent updations on rootfs

### Auto boot with custom kernel using uEnv command
