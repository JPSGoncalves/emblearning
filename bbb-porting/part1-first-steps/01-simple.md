# Simple Steps for the first boot

Choose a suitable directory, say eworkdir under your home directory, we'll refer it as ~/eworkdir from now onwards

## Prepare the pre built toolchain

Extract gcc-linaro-6.2.1-2016.11-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz in ~/eworkdir

`tar -xvf gcc-linaro-6.2.1-2016.11-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz`

You may rename to short convenient name

`mv gcc-linaro-6.2.1-2016.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf gcc-linaro-6.2.1`

Update PATH with new binaries in ~/eworkdir/gcc-linaro-6.2.1/bin as follows

`export PATH=$HOME/eworkdir/gcc-linaro-6.2.1/bin:$PATH`

The above setting is temporary and applicable to current shell only, add this to .bashrc or .bash_profile in your home directory to take this setting effective for every launch of new shell(.bashrc) or every login(.bash_profile)
eg:-  

`vi ~/.bashrc  #add above command at end of this file`

These steps are assuming that you are using 32 bit system for Host, follow [expert](02-expert.md) steps for 64 bit Host machine and betetr location for the toolchain

## Building the kernel

Extract the given tar ball with kernel source in workdir, i.e. ~/eworkdir, follow [expert](02-expert.md) steps for the making story behind KERNEL source

`tar -zxvf KERNEL.tar.gz -C ~/eworkdir`

Let's call the extracted kernel source, i.e. ~/eworkdir/KERNEL as KSRC from now onwards

Follow these steps for custom building of kernel source for the target

`make ARCH=arm mrproper`

`#copy config-4.9.0-step1 as .config in KSRC` follow [expert](02-expert.md) steps for the making story behind config file

`make ARCH=arm menuconfig`   #for further changes may skip initially

`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage modules dtbs`

Locate arch/arm/boot/zImage,arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-boneblack.dtb w.r.t KSRC and copy them to a temporary directory say ~/eworkdir/deploy

## Preparing rootfs

You may use bbrootfs.img prepared based on yocto rootfs  initially 

follow [expert](expert.md) for the making story behind bbrootfs.img

## Your First Boot

Install minicom on host computer

Conenct TTL cable conenctors with debug port of target with following configuration

1-Black(Ground), 4-Green(Rx), 5-White(Tx), leave red conenctor open which is Vcc

Copy zImage, am335x-boneblack.dtb, bbrootfs.img or myrootfs.img on 1st part of SD card

Stop the autoboot thru minicom to enter u-boot console

`mmcinfo`

`mmc dev 0`

`fatls mmc 0:1`

`fatload mmc 0:1 0x88080000 bbrootfs.img #note down size`

`fatload mmc 0:1 0x82000000 zImage`

`fatload mmc 0:1 0x88000000 am335x-boneblack.dtb`

`setenv bootargs 'console=ttyO0,115200n8 root=/dev/ram0 rw initrd=0x88080000,<size>'`

`bootz 0x82000000 - 0x88000000`
