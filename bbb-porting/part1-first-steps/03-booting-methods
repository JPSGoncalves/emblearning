## Let's try these alternate methods for booting the board

### Factory boot

Quickly testing your board with factory kernel image, rootfs

### Loading kernel image, dtb file, initrd.img via TFTP from Host PC

This is convinient for initial testing and eliminating the use of accessories like SD card and card reader.

### Custom kernel and rootfs on second part of eMMC

This is convenient to test your custom kernel against factory rootfs in eMMC with well defined utilities.

### Custom kernel and rootfs on second part of SD card.

This is most convenient for frequent updations on rootfs

### Working with uImage instead of zImage

Some u-boot versions may not allow zImage and expect uImage generated by mkimage utility wrapped with LOADADDRESS

### Auto boot with custom kernel using uEnv command

### Auto boot with boot.scr (TODO)

Note:- we are using factory u-boot loaded in eMMC part1 till now, you may try some steps later to work with your own bootloader.(TODO)
