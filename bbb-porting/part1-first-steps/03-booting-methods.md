## Let's try these alternate methods for booting the board

### Factory boot

Quickly testing your board with factory kernel image, rootfs

### Loading kernel image, dtb file, initrd.img via TFTP from Host PC

This is convinient for initial testing and eliminating the use of accessories like SD card and card reader.

### Custom kernel and rootfs on second part of eMMC

If you don't have a rootfs image initially,this is convenient to test your custom kernel against factory rootfs in eMMC with well defined utilities, For this set the boot parameters as follows

`setenv bootargs 'console=ttyO0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait` assuming  no SD card is present

### Custom kernel and rootfs on second part of SD card.

This is most convenient for frequent updations on rootfs, for this extract the contents of rootfs image into 2nd part of SD card and set the boot params as follows

`setenv bootargs 'console=ttyO0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait`

Note:- 1.If SD card is connected to the board, SD card partitions are probed as /dev/mmcblk0p1, /dev/mmcblk0p2 and eMMC partitions are probed as /dev/mmcblk1boot, /dev/mmcblk1p2.
       2.When there is no SD card is connected, /dev/mmcblk0p1,/dev/mmcblk0p2 represents eMMC partitions.
       3.Best way to ensure above device file names, boot the target once with factory kernel(auto boot) and check the entries in /dev directory.

### Working with uImage instead of zImage

Some u-boot versions may not allow zImage and expect uImage generated by mkimage utility wrapped with LOADADDRESS

### Auto boot with custom kernel using uEnv command

### Auto boot with boot.scr (TODO)

Note:- we are using factory u-boot loaded in eMMC part1 till now, you may try some steps later to work with your own bootloader.(TODO)
