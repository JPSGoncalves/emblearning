## Adding System Calls to the custom kernel

Add a new entry to system call table in `arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl`

`350 i386 testcall sys_testcall`

Replace the system call number 350 accordingly as per the sequence in your kernel source

Replace syscall_32.tbl with syscall_64.tbl for 64 bit architecture

> Caution:-
> The location and name of system call table is highly volatile across kernel versions,please do a simple search in
> kernel source or refer LXR tool once before proceeding

Add the definition of **sys_testcall** as a static module as follows

Create a new directory under **KSRC**, say **kernel/stest** and place **mysycall.c** in it with following code
```C
asmlinkage long sys_testcall(void) //SYSCALL_DEFINE0(testcall)
{
        printk("testcall\n");
        return 0;
}
```
and place a **Makefile** in **stest** subdir with following content

`obj-y += mysyscall.o`

Link the newly created directory to the **Makefile** of parent directory,i.e. in **kernel/Makefile** add the following line

`obj-y += stest/`

suitably near the linking of other sub dirs

Optionally add the prototype of your system calls to `include/linux/syscalls.h`

`asmlinkage long sys_testcall(void);`

Rebuild the kernel source to update custom kernel with added system call

`make -j <n>`

`make modules_install`

`make install`

## Testing the presence new system call in updated kernel(after rebooting)

`cat /proc/kallsyms | grep sys_testcall`

`nm vmlinux | grep sys_testcall`

`objdump -d vmlinux | less`

## Invoking system call from userspace

Write a simple user space program as follows
```C
#define __NR_testcall 350
int main()
{
   ret=syscall(__NR_testcall);
   if(ret < 0)
   {
      perror("testcall");
      exit(1);
   }
}
```
